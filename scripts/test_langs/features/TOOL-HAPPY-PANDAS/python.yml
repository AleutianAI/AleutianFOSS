      find_callers tool against Pandas. Target: DataFrame.__init__ constructor.
    query: |
      Who calls the DataFrame.__init__ constructor?
    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      DataFrame.__init__ has 3 primary callers in the inheritance chain:
      DataFrame.__init__ (self-delegation for alternate constructors),
      NDFrame.__init__ (parent class initialization), and Series.__init__
      (which shares the NDFrame base). Additional callers include factory
      functions throughout the codebase.

    reference_answer: |
      Circular dependencies exist where DataFrame operations return Series

      Leiden community detection finds clusters around core/frame (DataFrame ops),

    reference_answer: |
      In core/frame.py, weighted criticality ranks DataFrame.__init__,
      DataFrame.merge, DataFrame.groupby, and DataFrame.__getitem__
      highest because they combine high PageRank, betweenness, and
      degree centrality as central DataFrame operations.
