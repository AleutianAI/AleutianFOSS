      find_callers tool against Gin. Target: Context.JSON method.
    query: |
      Who calls the Context.JSON method?
    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      Context.JSON has 3 callers: AbortWithStatusJSON, Negotiate, and
      ErrorLoggerT. AbortWithStatusJSON aborts the handler chain and writes
      JSON, Negotiate uses JSON as a content-type option, and ErrorLoggerT
      writes error responses as JSON.

      Where is the Engine struct defined?
    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      The Engine struct is defined in gin.go. It is the main framework instance
      that holds configuration, route trees, and the middleware chain, and
      implements http.Handler via its ServeHTTP method.

    reference_answer: |
      The RouterGroup struct is defined in routergroup.go. It provides route

      The H type (alias for map[string]any) is used in JSON response helpers,

      The responseWriter struct is referenced in response_writer.go where it is

      find_weighted_criticality tool against Gin (test B). Focus on the routing layer.
    query: |
      What are the most critical functions in Gin's routing layer by weighted importance?
    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      In the routing layer, handleHTTPRequest, tree.getValue, and tree.addRoute
      score highest in weighted criticality. They combine high PageRank (many
      callers), high betweenness (bridging request to handler), and high degree.

    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      Functions with highest weighted criticality for breakage risk include
      Context.reset (called every request), Engine.ServeHTTP (entry point for
      all HTTP handling), and RouterGroup.handle (used by all route registrations).
