    description: >
      find_callers tool against Plottable. Target: Plot.renderImmediately method
      (defined on Plot at src/plots/plot.ts:434, not inherited from Component).
    query: |
      Who calls the Plot.renderImmediately method?
    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      Plot.renderImmediately has 1 caller: flush (via the Component.renderImmediately
      inheritance chain). The flush function triggers the full render pipeline
      which calls renderImmediately on each anchored component, including
      Plot subclasses that override it to add plot-specific SVG drawing.

      What functions does Plot.destroy call?
    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      Plot.destroy calls super.destroy for base Component cleanup, then
      iterates all scales via _scales and calls scale.offUpdate on each
      to unsubscribe from scale change notifications, preventing memory
      leaks from stale update callbacks.

    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      In the Component hierarchy, Component.render, Component.computeLayout,
      and Component.anchor rank highest by weighted criticality as they combine
      high degree centrality (many callers/callees), high betweenness (bridge
      layout to rendering), and high PageRank (called by all subclasses).

    expected_state: COMPLETE
    reference_answer: |
      Scale functions like Scale.scale and Scale._dispatchUpdate have high
      weighted criticality due to being called by every plot type, while
      plot-specific functions like PiePlot._sliceAngles have lower criticality
      as they serve only one visualization type.
